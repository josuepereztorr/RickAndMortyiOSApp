         - Set up the first view controller of your app, called the root view controller
         - Configure app settings and startup components, such as logging and cloud services
         - Register push notification handlers, and respond to push notifications sent to the app
         - Respond to app lifecycle events, such as entering the background, resuming the app, or exiting the app (termination)
